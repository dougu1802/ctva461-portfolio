# ctva461-portfolio
- This is my portfolio website showcasing the many skills I have learned in the past year with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript
- I hope to continue using this website as my portfolio site for jobs and anyone interested in hiring me. 
- As I continue to understand more and more in using HTML and CSS, I plan on updating my site as time goes on
- Being introduced to Bootstrap has made the process in developing my site a lot helpful.
